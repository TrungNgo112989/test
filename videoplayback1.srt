1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,211
Now is the era of Hanwha Life Esports 22

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,213
As the sole representative of LCK 22

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,216
They are advanced to the First Stand 22

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,013
The start of the first group competition 22

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,723 
was not that great 22

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,100
but we all pulled ourselves together

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,270
and it feels like we've been rewarded for our efforts

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,149
I'm happy and the best teams from each region
are gathering here

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,068
In that competition

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:31,406
we strongly want to prove ourselves with great determination

11
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,700
This was the first tournament we played as LCK CUP

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,119
and also the first using the Fearless Draft

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,454
Through twenty matches,

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,998
We improved both as a team and individually

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,042
It was a season of learning and growth

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,713
Although we faced difficulties early on

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,925
we gave each other feedback and set our direction well

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,594
During this season

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,304
fans' support felt more special

20
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,014
and more meaningful than ever

21
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,265
During this tournament

22
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,727
our performance improved significantly

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,896
so I felt both excitement and enjoyment

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,109
Now, the First Stand tournament will also follow the Fearless rules

25
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,360
And since we are

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,404
the team that won under these rules

27
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,364
we are confident we can perform well

28
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,242
Since it's a tournament held at LoL Park

29
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,913
We will do our best to show our strongest performance

30
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,127
Winning the LCK CUP and representing LCK at the First Stand

31
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,838
And since it is hosted in Korea

32
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,590
we will do our best to achieve great results

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,217
and aim for victory

34
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,849
As it is an upcoming international tournament

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,768
just like in the LCK CUP

36
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,895
I think I need to prepare diligently

37
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,401
I think I had a great time during the LCK CUP, so

38
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,489
I hope to continue enjoying the upcoming 
international matches as well

39
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,991
I sincerely thank the fans

40
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,159
I will continue to work hard

41
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,126
From a viewer's perspective, it may have been exhausting

42
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,753
and there were moments when faith wavered

43
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:14,843
but thanks to your unwavering support

44
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,845
we have the honor of representing LCK

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,014
so we want to meet the fans' expectations

46
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,352
I want to showcase the performance you desire

47
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,772
Just like in the LCK CUP, we will do our best

48
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,150
we will prepare well and aim for victory

49
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,737
I believe we are

50
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,407
the strongest contender for the championship
